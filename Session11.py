# Problem 1: Building a Playlist

# Uptown Funk -> Party Rock Anthem -> Bad Romance.

# 	def __init__(self, song, next=None):
# 		self.song = song
# 		self.next = next

# Problem 3: Glitching Out
# The following code attempts to remove the first node with a 
# given song from a singly linked list with head playlist_head
#  but it contains a bug!

# Step 1: Copy this code into Replit.

# Step 2: Create your own test cases to run the code against,
#  and use print statements and the stack trace to identify 
# and fix the bug so that the function correctly removes a 
# node by value from the list.

# Step 3: Evaluate the time and space complexity of the fixed solution.
#  Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe the
#  solution has the stated time and space complexity.

# Problem 4: On Repeat
# A variation of the two-pointer technique introduced in previous units 
# is to have a slow and a fast pointer that increment at different rates.

# We would like to check whether our playlist loops or not. Given the 
# head of a linked list playlist_head, return True if the playlist has a 
# cycle in it and False otherwise. A linked list has a cycle if at some 
# point in the list, the nodeâ€™s next pointer points back to a previous 
# node in the list.

# Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your
#  variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution 
# has the stated time and space complexity.
